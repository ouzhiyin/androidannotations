If you have troubles with `AndroidAnnotations`, here is a short guide to **kill the bugs**:

  * Check that your problem is not referenced in the  [Technical FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/androidannotations/wiki/FAQ#Technical_Questions)
  * Check the annotation processor logs (in Eclipse: **Window > Show View > Error Log**)
  * Check that your issue is not already reported in the existing [open issues](http://code.google.com/p/androidannotations/issues/list).
  * Ask for help on the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/androidannotations) or create a [new issue](http://code.google.com/p/androidannotations/issues/entry).
  * Don't forget to provide as much information as you can : IDE, version of IDE, build environment (Maven, Ant), OS, annotation processor logs, full stacktraces, annotated code & generated code & `AndroidManifest.xml` content
