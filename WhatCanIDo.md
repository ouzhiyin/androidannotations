If you're willing to help, but need ideas, here are some suggestions:

  * Pick up an [issue](http://code.google.com/p/androidannotations/issues/list), and give your opinion or [contribute code](http://code.google.com/p/androidannotations/wiki/HowToContributeCode).

  * Functional automated testing is done with the great [Robolectric](http://pivotal.github.com/robolectric/) framework. If you feel like rising up the test coverage, please go ahead ;-) .

  * Improve documentation (either the Javadoc or the wiki). We'll be glad to give you the needed rights to write wiki pages if you ask us to.
